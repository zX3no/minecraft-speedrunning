## Piglins

### Bartering

After dropping a gold ingot to a piglin, the piglin will examin it for 6 seconds.
It will then drop a random item from the drop table.

#### Player is not wearing any gold-armor
- 15 block radius range from the player
- Requires line of sight
- Light aggravation
- Can be de-aggravated by putting on gold-armor, losing line of sight
- Can be distracted with gold
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds

#### Player has broken a chest or gold block
- 16 block radius range from the player
- Does not require line of sight
- Medium aggravation
- Can be distracted with gold
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds
- If a piglin was already aggrevated by not wearing gold-armor, their aggrevation state will not be upgraded to medium.

- All piglins in a 16 block radius range of the damaged piglin will gain medium aggravation
- Heavy aggravation
- Cannot be bartered with or distracted with gold.
