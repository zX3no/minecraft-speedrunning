# Minecraft Speedrunning 1.16.1 Random Seed Glitchless

## Piglins

### Bartering

After dropping a gold ingot to a piglin, the piglin will examin it for 6 seconds.
It will then drop a random item from the drop table.

### Aggravation

Piglins will become aggravated for the following reasons:

#### Player is not wearing any gold-armor
- 15 block radius range from the player
- Requires line of sight
- Light aggravation
- Can be de-aggravated by putting on gold-armor, losing line of sight
- Can be distracted with gold
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds

#### Player has broken a chest or gold block
- 16 block radius range from the player
- Does not require line of sight
- Medium aggravation
- Can be distracted with gold
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds
- If a piglin was already aggrevated by not wearing gold-armor, their aggrevation state will not be upgraded to medium.

#### Player has damaged a piglin
- All piglins in a 16 block radius range of the damaged piglin will gain medium aggravation
- Heavy aggravation
- Cannot be bartered with or distracted with gold.
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds.

# Mechanics

## Perl Hang

## Blaze Bed

## Hunger Reset

# Overworld

## Lava

https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lava?oldid=1950804

Lava replaces air blocks generated in caves and ravines between y 1-10.
Lava does not replace air blocks inside mineshafts, dungeons or strongholds.
This is why mineshafts often lack the lava you might expect.

## Structures

> I'll want the loot tables for every structure. So it's clear what can be worth going to.
> Basic structure should be: Biomes, use in a speedrun, loot table.

### Lava Lake (Lava Pool)

Lava lakes can generate in any biome at any level.

They are easiest to find in flat biomes such as desert or plains.

### Stronghold
