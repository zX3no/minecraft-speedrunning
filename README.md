## Piglins

### Bartering

After dropping a gold ingot to a piglin, the piglin will examin it for 6 seconds.
It will then drop a random item from the drop table.

### Aggravation

Piglins will become aggravated for the following reasons:

#### Player is not wearing any gold-armor
- 15 block radius range from the player
- Requires line of sight
- Light aggravation
- Can be de-aggravated by putting on gold-armor, losing line of sight
- Can be distracted with gold
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds

#### Player has broken a chest or gold block
- 16 block radius range from the player
- Does not require line of sight
- Medium aggravation
- Can be distracted with gold
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds
- If a piglin was already aggrevated by not wearing gold-armor, their aggrevation state will not be upgraded to medium.

#### Player has damaged a piglin
- All piglins in a 16 block radius range of the damaged piglin will gain medium aggravation
- Heavy aggravation
- Cannot be bartered with or distracted with gold.
- Will lose aggrevation in x seconds.

# Mechanics

## Sand / Gravel

Sand and gravel are both affected by gravity so one might conclude that you cannot jump on it.
However, these blocks are unaffected by gravity for a short period after they are placed.

This can be used to climb up walls or break your fall if you don't have regular blocks.

> TODO: Check the source code for how long exactly they are unaffected by gravity.

Sand and Gravel can also be used to push entities and items.

If an entity is covered by sand or gravel it will move up.

This is useful for getting your items out a 2x1 hole that piglins.
Just drop a single gravel or sand overhead and the items will move up.
The items are moved because they are covered by a block.
The piglins don't move because they are 2 blocks tall and are not covered by the block.
A pig however, would be pushed up üêñüëÜ.

## Ender Pearls

Usually an ender pearl is thrown and when it hits the ground you will be teleported there.
However, there are some mechanisms that allow for a pearl to frozen (hung) after being thrown.

The most common way is to throw a pearl, wait for it travel a few chunks away, then reduce your render distance.
When a pearl is in the air and out of render distance it will not move.

When your render distance is increased to load in the pearl it will continue and hit it's target.

Ender pearls can also get stuck in soul sand water elevators.
This mechanic is known as ender pearl stasis chambers.

Pearls can also be moved with expolsions(TNT, Bed in Nether or End).
This is useful in ender pearl stasis chambers as the ender pearl can be stored and shot over large distances.
This is not used in speedruns as it is too complicated to setup.

However, if you throw an ender pearl then detonate a bed in the nether. The distance it travels will be significatly increased.

## Dolphins

Players who sprint-swim within a 9 block spherical radius of a dolphin receive Dolphin's Grace for 5 seconds‚Äå.
Players who already have Dolphin's Grace and continue to sprint-swim within a 15 block spherical radius of a dolphin will have it replenished.
The dolphin keeps following the player as long as they are sprint-swimming, allowing the player to swim under the speed boost for long distances.

Usually you would need to stop sprint-swimming to catch your breah and prevent drowning.
However there is a specific angle just before you leave the water which will allow you to sprint swim while out of the water.

Dolphins will pathfind to dropped items and push them.
This can be a problem if you have punched some kelp underwater as they may path to that instead of you.

> When dolphins are fed raw cod or raw salmon, they swim to the nearest shipwreck, buried treasure, or ocean ruins. TODO: TEST

[example here]

## Lava

https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lava?oldid=1950804

Lava replaces air blocks generated in caves and ravines between y 1-10.
Lava does not replace air blocks inside mineshafts, dungeons or strongholds.
This is why mineshafts often lack the lava you might expect.

## Structures

> I'll want the loot tables for every structure. So it's clear what can be worth going to.
> Basic structure should be: Biomes, use in a speedrun, loot table.

### Lava Lake (Lava Pool)

Lava lakes can generate in any biome at any level.

They are easiest to find in flat biomes such as desert or plains.

### Stronghold

### Woodland Mansion


As of `v1.11` Lava generates in woodland mansions: two blocks of lava generate in the "blacksmith room", and 25 blocks of lava generate in a secret "lava room".

# Nether

## Bastion

## Fortress

# End

## One-Cycle

## Zero-Cycle


----

#### Random Notes

When entering the end.
You should pause so that the dragon has time to spawn in.
Otherwise the dragon will lag around, which can make zero cycle impossible.

A sub-1 end split is always possible with zero-cycle.

Instaperch will be a low-1 or sub-1 split.

There are twelve pillars in the end.

The dragon spawns in the sky and slowly decends down.
There is some element of randomness with the pathing.

Zero requires a pillar at the front or back that is at a certain height.
If a tower is too tall, your bed will blow up the end crystal which will cause the dragon to fly away.

Sometimes shipwrecks can generate in different biomes causing them to change wood type and y-level.
All of the chests should generate but they might be at a different y-level.

When micro-lensing to find bastions, the bastion is not directly where the entity spikes. It's either on the left or right of your screen.
The players fov is a cone (view frustum).
